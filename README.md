# 1room English Translation
Full English transaltion for the game 1room -Runaway Girl- (1room -家出少女-) by Akari Blast! This translation covers all in-game text - all script and UI.

The translation does not modify any of the original game files. Instead it is using [BepInEx](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx
), [AutoTranslator](https://github.com/bbepis/XUnity.AutoTranslator), [INIfier.Bepin](https://github.com/ManlyMarco/INIfier.Bepin) and a custom BepInEx plugin to translate the game "on the fly". This way only the actual translations can be distributed, and the translation is very likely to work correctly on different game versions.

## How to install
1. Get the game. The translation was tested on v1.1.0 but it should work on newer versions without issues.
2. Get the latest release from the Releases tab above.
3. Extract the release to the root of your game. If you already have a BepInEx folder in your game directory, remove it before extracting the release.
4. Start the game. It should now be translated. You can open the options screen to confirm that the translation works.
5. Have fun!
